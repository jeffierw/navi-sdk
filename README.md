# ⚠️ NAVI SDK (Legacy)

> **⚠️ Important:** This version of the NAVI SDK is **no longer actively maintained**.
> We’ve released a **major upgrade** — faster, modular, and much easier to integrate.
> **New users should migrate to the new SDK packages.**

---

## 🚀 The New NAVI SDK

We completely rebuilt the SDK and split it into **4 focused packages** for a better developer experience:

* **🔹 Lending SDK** – Deposit, borrow, repay, liquidate, claim rewards, flash loans, and oracle queries
* **🔹 Bridge SDK** – Cross-chain bridging with real-time quotes and best routes
* **🔹 Aggregator SDK** – DEX aggregation across Aftermath, Bluefin, Cetus, DeepBook & more
* **🔹 Wallet Client** – Unified wallet + signing client with built-in Swap & Lending helpers

📚 **Developer Resources:**

* [📖 New SDK Documentation](https://sdk.naviprotocol.io)
* [🛠 Migration Guide](https://sdk.naviprotocol.io/navi-sdk-migration/lending)
* [💻 Source Code](https://github.com/naviprotocol/naviprotocol-monorepo)

> ⏳ **Note:** The old SDK will be deprecated in 1 month — please migrate soon!

## 📦 Installing the Legacy SDK (if you still need it)

```bash
npm i navi-sdk
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Always load your mnemonic from environment variables.
> Install dotenv:
>
> ```bash
> npm i dotenv
> ```
>
> [How to use dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

We still provide a [starter example project](https://github.com/naviprotocol/navi-sdk/tree/main/document) for developers maintaining the legacy version.
